# Oscars-Data
This repository contains the code for my final project for my DACSS 690A: Data Engineering course, taught by Professor Tyler Horan at UMass Amherst. This code scrapes data from the Oscars' website, stores it in different tables, and creates an app which users can interact with to see information and visualizations.
